# MedHelp-Hackathor-with-MobileAction

In the hackathon organized in cooperation with MobileAction, our topic was to make a mobile application that facilitates the lives of elderly people.
We focused on the health field. With Swift, we have developed a mobile application that reminds elderly and sick individuals of medication times and appointment dates, and can track their medication status (remaining tablet, usage pattern). If the user wishes, he can get a premium membership and consult with his doctor by one-to-one messaging. Adds reminders and appointment dates to the doctor's calendar. If the user is not premium, he or a relative should add the reminders. At the same time, the pharmacist can check the patient's medication status from his own screen. When necessary, he can call the patient and warn them that their medication is running low. It is an application developed in as little as 24 hours.
